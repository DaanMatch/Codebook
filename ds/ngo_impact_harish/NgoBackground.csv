As technology advances to match that of an international standard, so too science and medicine are progressing in leaps and bounds to try to tackle the endless list of challenges and ailments of a modern world. However hand in hand with such advances comes a phenomenal growth in population (India, being the fastest growing country in the world, is predicted to overtake china by population before the middle of this century) and the difficulties and strains that come from overcrowding. As more and more generations of people move to the cities to seek work and a better life so government attention is focused on maintaining these heaving metropolises. Even though there is a migration towards urban living, Tamil Nadu still holds over half its population in rural areas (51.55% rural to 48.45% urban, source: 2011 Census of India). Although less polluted than urban, rural life gives less access to the basic needs such as health care and education often purely down to the distances needed to travel and transport issues, a common theme in such isolated areas is to find children working hard just to help feed their families and education will become secondary. Thus life becomes about surviving rather than thriving.","JRDT has risen from its roots, helping communities in emergency and crisis situations towards getting themselves back to normal life, to its current status of working with rural communities to help raise their standard of living financially, hygienically, socially and educationally on a day to day basis towards a more self-sustained and prosperous future.

Initially a single-room drop-in centre, AAWC eventually developed into a resource centre to better address the women’s needs, providing them with professional counseling, medical care, micro-savings facilities, and other services – the Umeed (""hope"") program. As AAWC’s outreach team developed a regular home-visit schedule, they realised that the daughters of Umeed women were at great risk of being coerced into prostitution due to their extensive exposure to the brothel system and to their lack of educational opportunities. As a result, the Udaan (""flight"") program launched in October 2000 to prevent second-generation trafficking. In June 2002, AAWC expanded its services to include the young toddlers of women as well through the launch of the Umang (""joy"") program. Today, AAWC operates two centres, one in the Khetwadi lanes and another in the Kamathipura lanes, two communities which together comprise the largest and oldest red light district in Asia. As of March 2013, the organisation has served more than 1,500 women, 650 girls and 400 toddlers. Alumni of AAWC's programs include a financial analyst, teacher, medical compounder, dance instructor, photographer, retail executive, social workers, beauticians, chefs at an international luxury five-star hotel, and even a scholarship student at an American university / one of Newsweek ’s “25 Under 25 Women in the World",,,

Shanta Gandhi, an educator with eclectic interests, and diverse training in science, theatre, dance and politics had started working with a group of children in order to develop a curriculum that had relevance to their lives. The atmosphere was informal and the curriculum not pre-planned. It evolved naturally in response to the needs of that group and as a result of her interaction with those children. Children asked questions about their surroundings, and the process of finding answers (through games, songs and discussion) led naturally to questions regarding human evolution - how life emerged, why we are what we are, how our lives have changed from the past, and so on. Later, the curriculum was further developed in an experimental school attached to the B.M. Institute of Child Psychology and Development in Ahmedabad in the late 1950s. Here again, it was not based directly on the formal school curriculum but supplemented it. After a long interval, the programme was taken up in the 1970s at the Bal Bhavan, in New Delhi. Children who came there were provided an opportunity to interact with teachers, writers and artists, and to explore their surroundings through art, drama and dance, while all the time asking questions and discovering the answers. Unfortunately there was another long break before the programme was revived in Mumbai in the 1990s.

In cooperation with regional and international partners, and working with the communities, we aim to develop and provide integrated and innovative solutions that guide policy change and inspire action to directly benefit the mountain people and their environments. The Himalayas are the principal home of glaciers and the source of water for over 1 billion people living in connected river basins. They are also extremely vulnerable to climate change. Thus, there is a critical need to guide development that incorporates and is compatible with the threat of a changing climate.","The Central Himalayan Environment Association, CHEA in short, was founded on October 2, 1981, on a day which has special significance for India, being the birth-day of the Father of the Nation, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The society was registered soon afterwards in May, 1982. Arguably CHEA is one of the earliest societies founded in Northern India which had ' the environment and the livelihood of the people in the Himalayas ' as its core concern. Much water has flown in the great Himalayan rivers and the Indian Himalayas have since been witness to much distress, conflict, degradation, demographic dynamics, political restructuring and impacts of various global revolutions and their regional and local impacts. CHEA has since espoused many mountain causes, engaged itself actively in scores of action-researches on human and environmental aspects and livelihood-related projects and continues to be so involved to this day. Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 with the inclusion of Chapter 13- 'Managing Fragile Ecosystems : Sustainable Mountain Development' in the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) the importance of mountain social-ecological systems have been acknowledged for the first time on a global scale. Establishment of CHEA, let it be recalled, pre-dated the Rio Summit by more than a full decade. Certainly the perceptions of a seminar organised in October 1983 by CHEA in participation of academicians, activists and scientist to se the future course of action for the Indian Himalayas has to be re-evaluated in context of the insights the world at large and the Indian sub-continent in particular has gained and with which CHEA has a re-alignment of its strategy for the 21st century, both in context of local and global priorities. To ensure solution of increasing pressure on natural resource for rural livelihoods CHEA has developed strategies for stregthaning grassroots environmental governance and undertaking action research.",,,

Mission :Facilitating people’s organizations at the grass root level and coordinate to find solutions for the betterment of their life marching towards egalitarian society.","Human Education and Action for Liberation Movement abbreviated as HEAL Movement derives its name from the commitment to the right to life and livelihood of the Dalits who have been suffering from social exclusion and economic marginalization for centuries. There have been many barriers that contribute to the social exclusion and political- economic marginalization of the Dalits. The barriers are religious dogmas, political system and the caste system. Outwardly, they seem to be separate institutions but at functional level, there exists an unholy alliance among them against the Right to Life and Livelihood of the Dalits. The people with vested interests, mainly from the upper caste community, used to control these institutions and keep the Dalits under a semi bonded labor system without access to basic rights. The caste system, sanctioned by religion and supported by political system, justified the social exclusion of the Dalits and political – economic marginalization.  As a result, Dalits occupy the lowest rung of the social ladder in the social structure. Therefore, HEAL focused on the Human Education of the community.  Human education focuses on sensitizing them on the origin of caste system, religious institutions, their role in social exclusion and political marginalization of their community.  We felt that a community can be empowered only through education.  Only when they are educated about their situation, Rights and the ways to achieve their Rights they can act.  Hence massive awareness programmes were conducted to sensitize the people.  This sensitization, HEAL believed, would enable them to reject these doctrines of exclusion and bondage and assert their right to equality and dignity that would ensure their Liberation. The liberation entails collective Action by the people.  Therefore, HEAL imparted appropriate awareness education that would eventually lead them to understand their livelihood rights and act on strengthening their social capital - Movement - through grass root level organizing.  HEAL believed that it could facilitate this process through deeper level socio political education and functional training – a training that involved the women to participate in the action to address their rights and liberate themselves from the socio – cultural bondage. HEAL being a Right Based NGO, its interventions were initiated through lobby and advocacy with the civil society organizations for their Rights. Working in co-ordination with other like minded Movements is one of our strategies. The name HEAL reflects this line of thinking in its goal, strategies and in the programs implemented.",,,

Through her exposure to formal tenets of Dance Movement Therapy(DMT) training after workshops under several expert DMT specialist and therapists with the British Council, American Dance Therapy Association and other places, she was excited by the scope of the particular utility that dance and body movements could become a powerful rehabilitation tool as well as a method of advocacy.

In addition, Melghat has very poor transportation, almost 25% of the villages are unapproachable with no proper roads, etc. Even if a person has knowledge and awareness he is unable to access available medical facility. This underprivileged area had poor health care delivery system, hospital facilities & education. All these results in poor health indicators especially very high under 5 children mortality rate (>90/1000 live births), infant mortality rate(>60), maternal mortality rate (>250 / 1 lakh live births), age specific mortality rate(16-60 years) and malnutrition (>75%).

In line with this thought, Literacy India is looking at transforming the education landscape through exposing the student to a more innovative and non-traditional method of learning. This includes fun activities and workshops on group learning, drama, dance, role plays etc.Eminent personalities from different walks of life come and interact with the children and prove to be a catalyst to the child’s motivation and enthusiasm to do well. The interest generated in these activities also helps identify talent which, with further guidance can pursue further education or vocational training.OBJECTIVESAll Literacy India initiatives and programs are envisaged to be innovative, sustainable and replicable in different parts of the country. The primary objectives are:To support children in active schooling to provide minimum levels of learning.To provide women and children with vocational skills.To identify children from under privileged backgrounds and help build their confidence and awareness.To economically empower women from rural and slum areas.To nurture, mentor and assist children to become human resource assets in the community and future role models to many.To improve the self esteem and confidence of both women and kids from the under privileged segment.","Literacy India can rightly be synonymized with three very powerful words: Education, Empowerment and Employment. The very essence of Literacy India are these three E’s which are both powerful and paramount in transforming lives! Literacy India was born in 1996 as a non-profit organization with the objective of educating under privileged women and children, and empowering them to become self-reliant and employable. The name Literacy India is a misnomer because, although literacy is the predominant initiative of the organization, this initiative is reinforced with a variety of vocational skills and alternative models of education that are relevant, holistic and enriching. Capt. Indrani Singh, who conceptualized Literacy India says,” the idea is to equip underprivileged children and women with basic education and also identify, nurture and develop their latent talent and skills wherein empowering them and increasing their employability quotient”.",,,

The Programme starts with recruiting one wingman (mentor) per youth for a time span of two years. The Wingmen are paired with the child keeping the interests and needs of the child in mind. Skill building sessions: The wingman is responsible for enabling the youth to develop their personality by providing regular sessions on growth and life skills. At the same time, the wingman monitors the youths progress and customises the sessions. Career counselling: In addition to this, career counselling sessions are held for the youth to provide a direction and approach to the youths future. Academic support: Consistent subject support is provided to the youth to improve their overall higher secondary results. College and job scouting: Based on the progress, needs, interests and career counselling results of the youth, suitable colleges or job opportunities are considered. Procurement of legal documents: In the entire process, the wingman also enables the youth to secure their legal documents which will be needed by them in future. Funding and scholarship: All the youth under Propel belong to poor economic background. To motivate the youth to continue their studies and discourage drop out due to financial conditions, Propel attempts to sponsor the cost of education of its students. This include college fees and other living expenses. Aftercare support: Apart from this, the Programme realises the poor financial and emotional conditions which the youth have been exposed to which has had an impact on their growth and level of motivation. To combat this, the Programme has recently initiated Aftercare support to provide the youth a reliable mentor, after they secure admission in college or a job. The Aftercare mentor (wingman) engages and interacts with the youth periodically, to ensure that youth overcomes the social and economic hardships and focus on their growth.",,,

Rural and Tribal Development organization is established by Dr. D.V JAYAKUMAR M.A; B.Th; B.D (MBA); Ph.D (Founder and Managing Trustee), with the intention of developing rural areas and tribal people. According to Gandhian Philosophy, any nation can develop, only if the villages of that nation develop first. Hence our organization has selected rural areas for the all round development. Most of the area of  Madhya Pradesh is covered with mountains and forests and hence development is slow. Many of the areas are cut off from the main stream of life due to not having any approach/link roads. The district Hoshangabad is also of such area where development is very essential as most of the villages are tribal populated. This organization has initially taken up awareness campaigns to eradicate polio, AIDS, T.B, child labour and illiteracy in 15 villages around the target area. As literacy is the Forerunner of all developmental activities, this organization would like to enter first of all into the field of education. Literacy in Madhya Pradesh state and especially in the target area is very less due to forests, tribal domination and also due to lack of sufficient funds with the local Government. After 3 years of service in the villages through awareness campaigns, this organization would like to serve the target area more and so has registered the organization as a charitable Trust to receive funds through government as well as from non-government channels.",,,

These children are either in Observation Homes as they are deemed to have committed an offence, or in Childrenâ€™s Homes as they, either have no parents, or their parents cannot raise them up. While the motivation for these Homes is to bring about the protection of children who are vulnerable and need extra support, these children too are in need of special care, guidance and protection in their formative years if they are to become responsible and contributing members of society. Project Pragati works alongside four different Observation Homes and Childrenâ€™s Homes in order to meet the emotional and educational needs of children who reside there. We believe that education is vital in order to break the cycle of poverty and neglect that often plagues these childrenâ€™s lives. For this reason, we provide supplementary educational supports as well as basic computer literacy skills. In tandem with the authorities, we help in tracing the families of the children who have run away from their homes, reunite them, and also follow-up with those discharged from these Homes to help them complete their studies or to be trained in a skill. Our budget for 2015-16 is Rs 18.50 lakhs covering 400 beneficiaries, of which we require funding of Rs 9.56 lakhs for various activities which will benefit these 400 children.

On the other hand children mostly residing in urban areas of Kolkata and its periphery were provided access to quality education through community based study centers and through Anandadhara , a primary school. In all selected rural and urban work areas SPAN is implementing programmes designed to address long-term issues of community development backed up with advocacy action for pro-poor policy changes. The special focus has been to provide better overall convergence and inclusiveness of the programme. SPAN has organically evolved and grown with the changing times with its very own experiences of working with the community. A culture of open dialogue and sharing internally, amongst the staff and externally with the partner communities and stakeholders has been strongly encouraged. Thus several changes in its perspectives and its reflection on its strategies, programmes and projects are visible. The organization from a service based organization for specific target groups has gradually moved on to be a strong advocate of children and human rights.

Without access to toilets people are forced to openly defecate, and this enables diseases to spread easily and quickly resulting in widespread intestinal illness. This not only impacts on people’s ability to work or attend school, but also means already stretched finances need to be allocated on necessary medication. Open defecation strips people of their dignity; women and girls are disproportionately disadvantaged as, with no security or safety.VisionImproved Health and economic status through the provision of Sustainable sanitation and hygiene awareness.","Our primary focus is the alleviation of poverty. We do this in two simple, yet fundamental ways: 1. By introducing sanitation and water facilities that create and maintain good health, thereby giving individuals the ability to hold down a job. 2. By providing the infrastructure for work. With these two in place, the poorest people in the world can work their own way out of poverty rather than receive continual and long-lasting subsidies. We are after independence, not dependence. Wherever the Need India Services is a registered / incorporated under Section 25 of the 1956 Companies Act (ID No: U85190PY2009NPL002266); a non-profit organisation undertaking water and sanitation projects since 2,009. Since then, the Charity’s work has evolved through direct, on-the-ground experience to focus on what it believes to be the most important intervention that can be made in the development world – sanitation. Without proper, sustainable sanitation, no development work will be successful; every field of aid is impacted by its omission or lack of quality. Wherever the Need’s experience, borne out by data from ourselves and other agencies, has clearly shown that: • There is a major improvement in health leading to less work days missed – our data shows a 45% reduction within a year of toilets being installed (WTN, Pondicherry Baseline Survey 2014 and 2015); • Where sanitation facilities are installed in schools there is a 15% increase in the number of teenage girls enrolling (DFID data says 11%); • Children are sick less often which results in better school attendance records. Our data has shown a 43% reduction in school days lost twelve months after toilets being installed (WTN, Pondicherry Baseline Survey 2014 and 2015); • With half the hospital beds in the developing world being occupied by people suffering from diarrhoea, such improvements as shown above have a marked impact on personal, local and national healthcare costs (UN). Wherever the Need believe that any programme designed to alleviate poverty should start with sanitation. Without access to toilets people are forced to openly defecate, and this enables diseases to spread easily and quickly resulting in widespread intestinal illness. This not only impacts on people’s ability to work or attend school, but also means already stretched finances need to be allocated on necessary medication. Open defecation strips people of their dignity; women and girls are disproportionately disadvantaged as, with no security or safety, they are vulnerable to being assaulted or raped. Wherever the Need firmly believes in sustainable solutions and constructs ecological toilets (ecosan), otherwise known as Urine-Diverting Dry Toilets (UDDTs). 1. Sanitation facilities created in 58 Schools covering 24,823 children. In this, 14,700 girls and 10,123 boys got benefitted. 2. Existing sanitation facilities in 30 schools were repaired and brought back into use, benefitting another 18,640 children. In this; 11,230 girls and remaining 7,410 boys got benefitted. 3. Apart from the above, we have also helped the rural and urban children with sanitation facilities. 8,229 children (4,232 boys and 3,997 girls got the facilities. Through the sanitation facilities we could bring access to sanitation for a total of 17,179. 4. Hygiene education is an inherent part of the programme. At least 6 months to 8 months hygiene education is imparted. Apart from general health and hygiene practices education, menstrual hygiene education is also imparted to the girls in all the school. In the trainings for the village women group too we educate about the menstrual hygiene practices and needs. 5. In India 17,000+ people use our 2,350 Family ECOSAN toilets every day. 6.
