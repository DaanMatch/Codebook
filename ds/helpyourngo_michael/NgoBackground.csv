They soon came to feel that an improvement in agricultural production in rain-fed areas, provision of basic infrastructure, and educational facilities, were the most pressing needs of the people.  Therefore, with the primary objective of community development, VDS has facilitated multiple initiatives to ensure all aspects of its beneficiaries’ lives are impacted. Accordingly the programmes VDS has conceived, and run, fall in the categories of:   Women and Child Rights Campaign (WCRC):   This programme continued to be funded by USA based organization named Gophilanthropic. It was implemented by 6 paid activists and 250 village-based volunteers. They helped around 595 women and children secure their entitlements under various government schemes. VDS received cooperation from the district administration and the print media.  Education and Migrant Children School Project:  The NGO continued to run teaching centres at brick yards for migrant children. The teaching centres will yield results if the same group of children continue with schooling when they return to their villages and then come back in the following season to the teaching centres at the brick yards. In FY13, VDS had mentioned the plan to appoint personnel to conduct assessments of the children at their village schools to gauge if they have benefitted from the efforts made at the brick yard teaching centres. However it is not clear from the FY14 Annual Report if this appointment took place. Water scarcity in rain-fed areas in 2015 is likely to make it very difficult for children to continue their education in their native villages. VDS proposes to appoint personnel to safeguard the educational interests of the children at their native villages.  ",,,

Founded by veteran journalist Palagummi Sainath, PARI is a volunteer-run rural journalism platform that specializes in covering rural labour and the working lives of Indians through its network of reporters, professional filmmakers, film editors, photographers, documentary filmmakers and journalists (television, online and print).  PARI is both a living journal and an archive. It generates and hosts reporting on the countryside that is current and contemporary, while also creating a database of already published stories, reports, videos and audios from various sources. PARI is a multi-lingual platform that has content in up to ten Indian languages, including English, which is translated and reviewed by volunteers. PARI, as an online photojournalism interface, showcases the occupational, linguistic and anthropological diversity in India. All of PARI’s own content comes under the Creative Commons. Public access to PARI is free and the site is run by The CounterMedia Trust. Anyone can contribute to PARI through writing, shooting and recording videos on the everyday lives of everyday people.  Much of what makes the countryside unique could be gone in 20-30 years. We are losing worlds and voices within rural India of which future generations will know little or nothing. There is one place future generations the world over, including Indians, will visit more and more: the Internet. PARI aims to use the internet as a medium to build – as a public resource – a living, breathing journal and an archive aimed at recording people’s lives. Many worlds, one website. More voices and distinct languages than have ever met on one site.  PARI is trying to create subtitling in multiple Indian languages for each documentary they generate. The site's AudioZone will, over time, hold thousands of clips – conversations, songs, poetry – in every Indian language that they can record. PARI aims to help create informative and lively resources for students, teachers, schools, colleges and universities. As broadband access grows, it should mean lower costs for many students, as PARI is a free-access-to-public site. PARI is also building a Resources section, where they aim to put up reports related to rural India from organizations such as the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog), the United Nations, etc. ",,,

It works with, and for, the community to enhance livelihood that centres on Natural Resource Management. The organisation facilitates optimal use of resources and services for community benefit. It works in partnership with other organisations in the development sector to make the best use of government policies and schemes.  PRASARI works in two opposite agro-climatic zones of West Bengal. One district is located at the hilly Jalpaiguri (Himalayan Dooars) and the other is at the delta in the Sundarbans (near Bay of Bengal). Both receive adequate rainfall but still suffer from water scarcity, either due to impermeable land or intrusion of salinity. To help the residents, PRASARI emphasizes gravity based surface flow management and water harvesting.  In the past, PRASARI started out with System of Rice Intensification (SRI) as an entry point activity in all the villages it worked with. It would then shortlist the families which needed help in improving their livelihood. Self Help Groups (SHGs) were the primary community platform used for any sort of intervention. The groups were nurtured by the trained staff of PRASARI with a plan to achieve a targeted annual incremental income.  The NGO has shifted from a sub-sector approach of promoting SRI to family based interventions incorporating all other existing natural resources (agriculture, livestock and birds, and fishery). This has had three categorical effects on the families: 1) Year-long engagement with the families versus seasonal interventions; 2) Diversifying income sources and minimising the risks of single activity failure; 3) Generating ‘double arrows’ of increasing income and reducing expenditures.  Interventions in livelihoods in the past six years have exhibited some limitations and the learning thereof has led to interventions in addressing nutrition security, providing health awareness, and minimum bare-foot health support. PRASARI has also successfully launched a pilot program at the Sundarbans on ‘securing nutrition for children from home based resources’ through calculated resource use for growing nutrients. An assessment on the prevalent diseases with mothers has been done and based on this assessment, a support plan has been designed for execution. ",,,

Their dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to read, and has something good to read.  A large number of Indian NGOs are engaged in increasing child literacy. Research reveals that one in three school-going children cannot read fluently. Children who are unable to read are unable to learn, as they can't understand what is being taught to them. This contributes to high dropout rates in schools. Pratham Books supports child literacy by publishing and distributing affordable books to children who have limited reading resources.  In the last decade, Pratham Books has published over 300 titles in English and 18 major Indian languages. The NGO has printed story-cards to jump start a love for reading. A majority of the 2,000 books published to date are priced below Rs50. With the aim to reach 200 million Indian children, Pratham Books continues to build alliances with leading publishing houses (like Orient Longman) to achieve this goal.  Story Weaver is a platform that hosts stories in languages from all across India, so that every child can have an endless stream of stories in her mother tongue to read and enjoy. All the stories are available under Creative Commons licenses which means that the stories are free to read, and can be translated into new languages, new stories can be created, and artworks can be freely accessed, by anyone.  Donate-a-Book is a unique crowd funding initiative by Pratham Books to help bridge the gap between those who want to help children read, and those who need books for children. The idea is to build a Reading India together by making storybooks accessible to thousands of children and spread the joy of reading. Around 42,000 books have been pledged so far under the Donate-a-Book initiative.  ",,,

Toybank works towards bridging the gap between children from different backgrounds by creative play, group events and community events. Toys are also a means to channelize their energies towards developing social and communication skills,this forms the premise of their ideology of Power of Play.   Toybank works with a network of volunteers to execute their program to induce familiarity with the play groups where children are in an environment of comfort to develop their confidence and help them become better thinkers. Since inception Toybank has touched the lives of around 500,000+ children from various backgrounds through their centers across 28 states/UTs. It works with several partner NGOs and has also started work in rural areas.  Donors are encouraged to give toys in good condition and it ensures that these are clean and appropriate for children before distribution. Toys are gift wrapped and distributed one-on-one to less privileged children. Toybank has noticed visible changes (beyond expectations) in the children they guide at their various centers in terms of better attendance at schools, increased efficiency in English, better emotional balance and reduced aggression.

Both the young adults, who work with them as volunteers, and the children, come from the same communities, enabling a relationship that is both close and constant. The young adults are trained to deliver the activity-based curricula Magic Bus has pioneered, to bring about changes in behaviours and practices. They work to promote gender equality, access to education and health services, as well as on developing a child's social and emotional skills. Their other key role is to work with the child’s support structure: the parents, the community at large and local institutions to ensure the change they make results in social, emotional and economic well-being for all children living in that area.  The programme delivered has strong grounding in academic research and is based on classical learning theories. Sporting activities and games are structured into each session to make them fun and appealing to children. Sessions are designed to represent real-life situations and challenges so children are able to relate these back to their daily lives.   Magic Bus has partnerships with Comic Relief, Laureus, Marchesa, Mondelez, Bloomberg, Nestle, Barclays, Coca Cola, HSBC, ICICI Foundation, Bernard Lewis Charitable Trust, BMW Group India, Vodafone, Asian Paints, Herbal Life, Tech Mahindra, Reliance Foundation, Tata Power, Boeing, ICRW-MacArthur, Prudential, Mastek, EClerx, FIFA, etc. ",,,

With a view to inculcating reading habits among them, BREAD has set up 1024 in the past 9 years, thereby benefitting almost 4 lakh students annually.  An Expert Committee selects books of interest to children falling in the 9-15 years age group. Each BREAD Library consists of 600-650 books and has a corpus of Rs 10,000 to distribute prizes to children. BREAD selects government schools securing six or more National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship (NMMS) awards in a year, for setting up its libraries. Donors can sponsor a library for Rs35,000. A donation of Rs2,000 enables it to replenish 80 books in its existing libraries. To sustain the interest of students, it adds 80-100 new books to its existing libraries on a rotation basis.  Responsibility of managing the libraries is given to a teacher by the Headmaster. The teacher in turn, selects three responsible students from each class to manage the library during their library period. This helps the students develop team spirit, leadership and managerial skills and also relieves the teachers from the burden of additional work of managing the libraries. BREAD has set up libraries in 617 NMMS schools and felicitated 1,772 Headmasters and teachers for their selfless service.  BREAD distributes prizes (10 for each school) to students for the best write-ups since write-ups are conclusive proof of students having read the books.
